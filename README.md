Code Repository of my Master's Project

The 'Everything' Folder contains every single file used in my project. It is a mess of testing functions, code that wound up not getting used at all, and mathematical equations which were, frankly, incorrect entirely. It was only uploaded as a form of log-keeping
The 'Files of Interest' Folder contains a slightly more structured version, with subfolders: iqms, vector graphics, edge-equation-application code, and colouring functions. There exists separate 'ReadMe's within each folder.
