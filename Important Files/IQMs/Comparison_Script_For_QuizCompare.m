%I've set the comparison folder as 'Test1_comparisonqs', it has
%sub-folders. in each sub-folder there are jpegs. the main jpeg has the
%word 'grid' in it. This jpeg is the reference jpeg. compare all other
%jpegs to it.

%do the usual tests (ssim, ms_ssim, mse, every. single. metric. you. can.
%think. of. ALL. THE. IMAGE. COMPARISON. TESTS!!!)

%Also check Cable's thing... i think i'll do this mostly tomorrow tbh...
%lemme just log all of the current IQM stuff
