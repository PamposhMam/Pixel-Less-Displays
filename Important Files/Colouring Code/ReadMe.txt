The last bit I worked on, so forgive me for the MANY mistakes I might make in this read me file:

Solid Colouring:
Use: Quantisation_Testing_Colour_Code
    Includes function: RECT_colour.m



Functions:
RectXPONential_Gaussian: Rect with a Gaussian convolved with it
RectXPONential_Traingle: Rect w a triangle function convolved with it
Exponential_and_Rect: testing code for the functions. Might need to alter it.
