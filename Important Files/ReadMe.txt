%% The language used in these files is MATLAB
%% Separate ReadMes exist in each file, but here is a brief description of all folders:

(1): IQMs:
*Excel sheets containing summary statistics of each image used in the polling, hosted on the website OpinionX
*Code to generate the values of the proposed image features
*Correlation code to find the Pearson Correlation statistics of the data

(2): Vector Graphics Code (not automatic applicator)
*Code to create a Line Hologram
*Code to create an Arc Hologram
*Code to create CLERP (failed)

(3): Automatic Application of Edge Equations
*Code to convert an image into edge-only format
*Code to process an edge-only version of an image and generate a hologram from it through application of the Fourier Transform

(4): Colouring Functions
*Code to create a quantised solid-square 'painting' of an arbitrary greyscale image (the code will make it grey for you!)
*Functions pertaining to faded square colouring tools
